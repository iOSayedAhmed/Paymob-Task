# Movie Listing App

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Movie Listing App developed using UIKit, Xib files, MVVM architecture, and Coordinator pattern. The app fetches movie data from a remote server using URLSession with Async Await, and manages state and reactive programming using Combine. Core Data is used to store favorite movies locally. Unit tests are included to ensure the reliability and functionality of the code.

## Features
- **UIKit**: Used for building the user interface.
- **Xib Files**: Utilized for designing reusable views and components.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Implements Model-View-ViewModel for a clear separation of concerns.
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Manages navigation flow and view controllers.
- **URLSession with Async Await**: Fetches data asynchronously from the server.
- **Combine**: Handles reactive programming and data binding.
- **Core Data**: Stores favorite movies locally.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensures code reliability and functionality.
